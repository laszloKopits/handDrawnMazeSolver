# handDrawMazeSolv
BFS to solve hand drawn mazes.  Implemented in python 3 and openCV. Will default to running on webcam feed if no argument is given.  In webcam mode, press s to take a screencap of the image on the webcam or press q to quit.

Alternatively, run from terminal with argument for image file to solve that maze.
